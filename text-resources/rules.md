That means no NSFW content, no harmful material(e.g. viruses, malware, spyware), and do not harass people.

__**2. Regarding spam and raids.**__
We do not associate with raiding groups, any members organizing raids under our name will be banned. Spam is not tolerated, and will be punished as the mods see fit.

__**3. English is the main language & keep chat clean**__
The majority of people on this server speak English, and may not understand your language, thus speaking in English is required, unless it is relevant to the current topic.

__**4. Treat everyone with respect.**__
If you want to say something that in real life would get aa punch in the face, don't say it.

__**6. Regarding alternate accounts(alts)**__
You are allowed to use an alt, however we'd like if you made that clear and do NOT use an alt to circumvent a ban, if your ban was temporary, this will make it permanent or make it last longer.

__**7. Moderators/Admins/ToAsgaard may act at their own discretion.**__
If you do something bad, not specified here, mods/admins/ToAsgaard can still ban or kick you.
